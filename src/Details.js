    <h4>PROJECT</h4>
    <ul >
    <li>
    <p>Have done a mini project titled<b>“THERMISTOR CONTROLLED FIRE
ALARM”</b>.Thethermistor is sensitive to heat.When fire breaks out,the thermistor
senses the change in temperature and allows current to pass through by closing the
circuit.The circuit consists of a transformer for stepping down the voltage and an
alarm is connected to indicate emergency.</p></li><li className="text-justify"><p>
Have done a main project titled<b>" LEG AND ARM REHABILITATION
AND MOBILITY AID FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY PATIENTS"</b>. It is mainly
prepared for the physiotherapy patients who are very low in economy. Normally,
physiotherapy patients are treated by physiotherapist and its cost is high. So that we
develop this kit for helping this type of patients. It is more efficient and less cost
compared to other kit. It's hardware and requirements are Arduino Uno,
Bluetooth,LCD,LED,power supply,DC gear motor,Regulator,Relay driven
circuit,Transformer,Resistor,Switch and Embedded C. It's working is so simple to use
any people and don't need any other person. It is controlled by both bluetooth and
manual method. Bluetooth is connected to mobile device and operated in the mobile
application. Manual method is controlled by switch and regulator if any person didn't
have mobile phone. It's motion is upward and downward and left and right direction
in both leg and arm. It costs less than the physiotherapist salary cost.</p>
